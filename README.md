# IkeoWorld

Let's help the Franckys explore the IkeoWorld !

#### Specifications #

Welcome in the Ikeo world ! Ikeo world is a rectangular area in 2 dimensions divided into regular small box. In this world lived the Francky, a nice family who love explore the wordl around them.
Their final goal is to explore all the Ikeo world, that's why we'll control the Francky's family to explore it.

The Francky are represent by :
* their position X and Y (coordinated)
* their orientation (north, east, west and south)

The Francky can make only 3 actions :
* **Go right :** The Francky turn 90° right
* **Go left :** The Francky turn 90° left
* **Move :** Franck move forward the direction where he's oriented

But there's some strict rules to respect in Ikeo Word !
* First, you can't go out of the world (rectangular area)
* Only one Francky could be on a small box
